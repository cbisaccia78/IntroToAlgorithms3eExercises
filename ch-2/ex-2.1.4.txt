Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element
arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in
an (n+1) element array C. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for
adding the two integers.

FORMAL PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Input: Two n-element bit-arrays.
Output:  An (n+1) element bit-array containing the sum of the first 2 arrays, interpreted
as integers.

PSEUDOCODE:
[1,0,1]
[1,1,1]

CARRY = 0
for i=n downto 1
    C[i+1] = (A[i] + B[i] + CARRY) % 2
    if A[i] + B[i] + CARRY >= 2
        CARRY = 1
    else
        CARRY = 0
C[i] = CARRY
