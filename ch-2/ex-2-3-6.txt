Observe that the while loop of lines 5â€“7 of the INSERTION-SORT procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray A[1::j-1]

Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to O(logn)?


ANSWER:

No, we still need to move all the j-1 elements up 1 in the worst case, which is still a O(n) operation.
