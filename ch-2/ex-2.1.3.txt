PROBLEM 2.1.3

DESCRIPTION:

Consider the searching problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers [a_1, ..., a_n] and a value v. 
Output: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not
appear in A.
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking
for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that
your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

PSEUDOCODE:

linearSearch(A, v)
    for i in [1..n]
        if A[i] == v
            return i
    return NIL

LOOP INVARIANT:

At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray
A[1..i-1] does not contain the element v.

INITIALIZATION:
The subarray is empty before the first iteration of the for loop,
so it is vaccuously true. 

MAINTENANCE:
if A[1..i-1] does not contain v, and we then show that A[i] != v, 
then it follows that A[1..i] does not contain the element v.

TERMINATION
If v is found, the program returns the proper index. 
If we progress past the for loop, we know based on the invariant
that A[1..n] does not contain v.
